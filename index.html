On this tour, 8 separate cable rides take you from one ridge top to another, across valleys and streams. There are 14 land based platforms and 1 tree platform with a view of the coast. The Flight of the Toucan zipline tour is a much an e ological experience as a canopy adventure. It is suitable for the whole family. Children as young as three have done it as have several octogenarians. This is a great way to see and learn about the tropical rainforest and have fun at the same time.
